d) What is the average difference of gross horse power(hp) between automobiles with 3 and 4 number
of cylinders(cyl)? Also determine the difference in their standard deviations.
> hp_diff_3_vs_4 <- mean(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 3, "hp"]) - mean(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, "hp"])
> sd_diff_3_vs_4 <- sd(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 3, "hp"]) - sd(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, "hp"])
> cat("Average difference of hp between 3 and 4 cylinders:", hp_diff_3_vs_4, "\n")
Average difference of hp between 3 and 4 cylinders: NaN
> cat("Difference in their standard deviations:", sd_diff_3_vs_4, "\n\n")
Difference in their standard deviations: NA
e) Which pair of variables has the highest Pearson correlation?
> cor_matrix <- cor(mtcars)
> cor_max <- which(cor_matrix == max(cor_matrix[upper.tri(cor_matrix)], na.rm = TRUE), arr.ind
= TRUE)
> var1 <- rownames(cor_matrix)[cor_max[1,1]]
> var2 <- colnames(cor_matrix)[cor_max[1,2]]
> correlation <- cor_matrix[cor_max]
> cat("Pair of variables with the highest Pearson correlation:", var1, "and", var2, "\n")
Pair of variables with the highest Pearson correlation: disp and cyl
> cat("Correlation coefficient:", correlation, "\n")
Correlation coefficient: 0.9020329 0.9020329
